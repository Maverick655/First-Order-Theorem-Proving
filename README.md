# First-Order Theorem Proving with Machine Learning

Welcome to the First-Order Theorem Proving with Machine Learning project repository! This project explores the application of machine learning techniques, specifically classification and regression, to first-order logic theorem proving.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to develop machine learning models that can effectively automate the process of theorem proving in first-order logic. By training classification and regression models on a dataset of theorem-proving problems and their corresponding solutions, we aim to predict whether a given theorem is provable and estimate the difficulty of proving it.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of:
- Theorem-proving problems in first-order logic
- Solutions or proofs for each problem

## Techniques Used
1. Classification:
   - Classifying whether a given theorem is provable or not.
   - Utilizing features extracted from theorem statements, such as syntactic and semantic properties.
   
2. Regression:
   - Estimating the difficulty or complexity of proving a theorem.
   - Using features such as the length of the theorem statement, the complexity of the logical structure, and historical difficulty ratings.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/first-order-theorem-proving-ML.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Download the theorem-proving dataset and preprocess it as necessary.
4. Train and evaluate machine learning models using classification and regression techniques.
5. Experiment with different feature representations, model architectures, and hyperparameters to improve performance.

## Usage
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the theorem-proving dataset, extract relevant features, and split it into training and testing sets.
2. **Model Training**: Train classification models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, neural networks) to predict theorem provability and regression models to estimate theorem difficulty.
3. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and mean squared error.
4. **Experimentation**: Experiment with different machine learning algorithms, feature representations, and hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
